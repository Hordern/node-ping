# A Node uptime monitor

Node-ping is a simple app that monitors the availabilty of your websites. 

**Note:** Node-ping uses GMail to send down-time nofication emails, you are required to create an [application specific password](https://accounts.google.com/IssuedAuthSubTokens) on your Gmail account and update the `config.json` file.

## How it works
 
1. Download the repo: `git clone https://github.com/qawemlilo/node-monitor`.

2. Create [an application specific password](https://accounts.google.com/IssuedAuthSubTokens) from your Gmail account and update the `config.json` file.

3. List all websites that you want to monitor in `websites.json` and run `node app` command to start monitoring your websites.
